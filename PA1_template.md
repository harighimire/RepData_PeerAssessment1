Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
========================================================

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data

Loaded and transformed the activity dataset for analysis.

## What is Mean Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day?

A histogram of total steps per day was created.  
- **Mean:** ~9354 steps  
- **Median:** ~10395 steps  

## What is the Average Daily Activity Pattern?

A time series plot shows average steps per 5-minute interval.  
- **Interval with maximum average steps:** 835

## Imputing Missing Values

There were 2304 missing values.  
Missing values were imputed using mean for each interval.  
Post-imputation, histograms showed higher consistency.  
- **Mean:** ~10766  
- **Median:** ~10766

## Are There Differences Between Weekdays and Weekends?

A panel plot showed that activity is higher and starts earlier on weekdays compared to weekends.

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates daily activity trends and confirms the effect of imputation. Weekday-weekend patterns differ significantly.
