<h1>Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1</h1>
<h2>Loading and Preprocessing the Data</h2>
<p>Loaded and transformed the activity dataset for analysis.</p>

<h2>What is Mean Total Number of Steps Taken Per Day?</h2>
<p>A histogram of total steps per day was created.<br>
<b>Mean:</b> ~9354 steps<br>
<b>Median:</b> ~10395 steps</p>

<h2>What is the Average Daily Activity Pattern?</h2>
<p>A time series plot shows average steps per 5-minute interval.<br>
<b>Interval with maximum average steps:</b> 835</p>

<h2>Imputing Missing Values</h2>
<p>There were 2304 missing values.<br>
Missing values were imputed using mean for each interval.<br>
Post-imputation, histograms showed higher consistency.<br>
<b>Mean:</b> ~10766<br>
<b>Median:</b> ~10766</p>

<h2>Are There Differences Between Weekdays and Weekends?</h2>
<p>A panel plot showed that activity is higher and starts earlier on weekdays compared to weekends.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis demonstrates daily activity trends and confirms the effect of imputation. Weekday-weekend patterns differ significantly.</p>
